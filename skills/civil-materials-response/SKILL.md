# Civil Materials Response

Build reviewer response packages that are respectful, evidence-first, and revision-verifiable.

## Protocol

1. Read [manifest.yaml](manifest.yaml), then load every `always_load` file.
2. Detect `response_task`, `comment_type`, and `journal_family`.
3. Load only the matching reference files.
4. Produce a point-by-point response, revision action table, rebuttal strategy, or risk audit.
5. Do not promise experiments, analyses, or manuscript changes unless the user has provided evidence or explicitly chooses that revision path.

## Default Output

Use `assets/templates/response-package-template.md`.

Each reviewer comment should become:

- comment ID,
- reviewer concern,
- concern type,
- response strategy,
- manuscript action,
- evidence or data needed,
- polite response draft,
- risk note.

## Civil Materials Response Rules

- Start with agreement or clarification when possible; avoid defensive language.
- Keep "response to reviewer" and "change made in manuscript" separate.
- For mechanism comments, tie the answer to FTIR, SEM, fluorescence, rheology, hydration, or other actual evidence.
- For performance comments, cite test conditions, standards, repeatability, statistics, or limitations.
- For journal fit comments, avoid arguing prestige; argue scope, evidence, and contribution.
- If a reviewer is correct, fix the manuscript and say exactly where.
- If a reviewer is partially mistaken, acknowledge the valid part, explain the boundary, and revise text to prevent misunderstanding.

Use `scripts/build_response_package.py` to scaffold a point-by-point response package.

Use `references/response-patterns.md` when the reviewer comment matches a high-frequency scenario such as language revision, more references, weak novelty, insufficient comparison, small sample size, missing error bars, raw data request, conflicting reviewers, or requested experiments beyond scope.

Use `references/response-document-format.md` when the user needs a revision package format, tracked-changes handoff, author response layout, or revision cover letter.

Use `examples/cbm-major-revision-response-example.md`, `examples/ccc-methodology-critique-response-example.md`, and `examples/rmpd-minor-revision-response-example.md` as concrete models.

Use `tests/rubric.md` to evaluate response quality across 6 dimensions: Completeness, Traceability, Factuality, Tone, Actionability, and Domain-fit.

Use the pressure tests to check that responses stay respectful, evidence-bound, and honest about missing data:

- `tests/pressure-tests/aggressive-reviewer-mechanism-request.md` — hostile tone, missing characterization evidence.
- `tests/pressure-tests/conflicting-reviewers.md` — incompatible reviewer requests, editor priority.
- `tests/pressure-tests/major-revision-missing-evidence.md` — missing DSC/TG, small sample size, absent durability data.
- `tests/pressure-tests/impossible-experiment.md` — field trial limitations, LCCA requirements.
- `tests/pressure-tests/defensive-draft-audit.md` — hostile draft language, dismissive tone.
