# Civil Materials Research - Router

This skill is a civil-engineering adaptation of the `nature-skills` style:

- A short router decides the task, material domain, and journal target.
- Stable rules live in `static/`.
- Detailed journal and topic notes live in `references/`.
- Output must be usable immediately: a topic angle, review outline, experiment matrix, data interpretation, manuscript section, journal fit table, submission package, figure plan, PPT structure, data/FAIR package, or reviewer-risk audit.
- Dedicated companion skills handle deep reading, polishing, citation mapping, reviewer responses, PPT/PPTX, figures, and data/FAIR packaging.

Do not answer from this router alone. Always load the manifest and the relevant fragments.

## Routing protocol

Follow these steps every time this skill is invoked.

### 1. Load manifest and core files

Read [manifest.yaml](manifest.yaml). Then read every file under `always_load`.

These files define the operating stance, evidence contract, and workflow shared by all civil materials tasks.

### 2. Detect axes

Detect these values from the user request:

- `task`: research-positioning, reading, literature-review, citation-mapping, experiment-design, data-analysis, manuscript-writing, journal-targeting, submission-package, reviewer-response, figure-table, presentation, data-fair, reviewer-audit.
- `domain`: asphalt-pavement, cement-concrete, construction-materials, steel-metal, geotechnical-materials, timber-masonry, waterproofing-sealants, sustainability-durability, civil-generic.
- `journal`: cbm, cbm-transportation, ccc, cscm, jbe, rmpd-ijpe, jre, generic.

If the user says `CCS`, treat it as ambiguous. If journal choice matters, ask whether they mean `Case Studies in Construction Materials` (`CSCM`) or another journal. If the task is not a submission decision, use `generic` and mention the abbreviation risk.

State the detected route in one short line before producing the main output, for example:

`Route: manuscript-writing / asphalt-pavement / cbm-transportation.`

### 3. Load matching fragments only

Read the mapped files for the detected `task`, `domain`, and `journal`. Do not read every file in `static/`.

Load multiple task fragments only if the user explicitly asks for a combined output, such as "make a review outline and PPT". If a request spans the full research cycle, load `research-positioning` first, then the specific downstream task.

### 3.5. Use companion modules for deep production work

When a request is clearly one of these specialized tasks, prefer the companion skill:

- Full paper reading, translation, or literature matrix -> `civil-materials-reader`.
- Evidence-chain reading audit, claim-evidence-mechanism-boundary table, or paper-to-review extraction -> `civil-materials-reader`.
- Literature search strategy, citation matrix, reference gap audit, or claim-source map -> `civil-materials-citation`.
- English polishing, Chinese-to-English polishing, or journal-style language tightening -> `civil-materials-polishing`.
- Claim strength, overclaiming, causality, novelty, or Chinese-to-English language-rule audit -> `civil-materials-polishing`.
- Reviewer response, rebuttal letter, major/minor revision response package, or point-by-point replies -> `civil-materials-response`.
- PPT, group meeting slides, journal-club deck, or thesis-report deck -> `civil-materials-paper2ppt`.
- Actual `.pptx` file generation, preset deck scaffold, or Markdown/JSON-to-PPTX conversion -> `civil-materials-pptx`.
- Journal-ready plots, figure package, SVG chart, or figure audit -> `civil-materials-figure`.
- FAIR data audit, dataset package, raw/processed data organization, metadata, or data availability statement -> `civil-materials-data`.

Use this router first when the task also needs topic positioning, journal fit, experimental evidence, or civil-materials strategy.

### 4. Produce the requested output

Apply rules in this priority order:

1. Core stance: evidence first, no invented mechanisms, no inflated novelty.
2. Evidence contract: every claim needs a measurement, reference, figure, or explicit missing-input flag.
3. Domain fragment: use the right material logic and tests.
4. Journal fragment: fit the journal's scope, article type, and likely reviewer expectations.
5. Task fragment: produce the deliverable in the requested language and format.

If evidence is missing, do not fabricate. Use placeholders such as `[needs FTIR evidence]`, `[confirm dosage range]`, or `[journal scope needs live verification]`.

### 5. Reach for references only when needed

Open `references/` files only when the request needs deeper help:

- Waterborne epoxy emulsified asphalt mechanism, tests, and paper logic -> `references/asphalt-waterborne-epoxy.md`.
- Journal selection across civil materials outlets -> `references/journal-shortlist.md`.
- Submission-risk or self-review checklist -> `references/reviewer-risk-checklist.md`.
- Output templates for abstracts, highlights, cover letters, graphical abstracts, and PPTs -> `references/output-templates.md`.
- From data to figures to manuscript claims -> `references/data-to-manuscript.md`.
- Statistical method choice, uncertainty, replicate count, or significance wording -> `references/statistical-methods.md`.
- ASTM/EN/JTG/GB/AASHTO/RILEM method mapping and test comparability -> `references/test-standards-mapping.md`.
- GB/T or JTG to ASTM/EN/ISO manuscript language and comparability cautions -> `references/standards-mapping.md`.
- Instrument/sample-preparation guidance for FTIR, SEM, fluorescence, XRD, TG/DTG, DSC, AFM, and rheology -> `references/characterization-guide.md`.
- Sustainability, low-carbon, LCA, recycled-material, waste-utilization, or service-life environmental claims -> `references/sustainability-claims-guide.md`.
- Master's thesis roadmap, semester planning, review-to-experiment timeline, or paper pipeline planning -> `references/thesis-timeline.md`.
- Companion skill coordination, including citation, response, data/FAIR, and PPTX handoff -> `references/companion-modules.md`.
- Full-module pressure testing and failure-mode validation -> `references/pressure-test-suite.md`.
- Concrete module examples and output shapes -> `examples/library/library-index.md`.

### 6. Verify live journal facts before final targeting advice

Journal scope, APCs, indexing, article types, guide-for-author rules, review policy, and impact metrics can drift. If the user asks for current submission advice, latest ranking, APCs, or exact formatting, browse official journal pages before finalizing.

## Boundaries

Use this skill for research judgment and writing support. It is not a substitute for:

- Actual experimental data.
- Supervisor or co-author approval.
- Current official journal instructions.
- Safety, ethics, or institutional requirements.
