# materials-figure

Nature-style figure production and audit for materials manuscripts. The
skill treats figures as evidence packages with source data, caption boundaries,
backend discipline, and export QA instead of as loose images.

## When To Use

Use this skill when you need figure planning, mechanism maps, evidence
heatmaps, dosage-window plots, characterization panels, review figures, or a
full figure package for materials research, especially WER-EA workflows.

## Inputs

- source data, reader-package figure handoff rows, or citation-screening inputs
- target figure archetype such as mechanism map, evidence heatmap, graphical
  abstract, or characterization panel
- export constraints and journal expectations
- backend choice: Python or R

## Outputs

- figure contract and panel logic
- figure package with script, source data, exports, caption, QA report, and
  asset manifest
- WER-EA atlas assets and review-figure planning surfaces
- reviewer-safer caption boundaries that separate measured from inferred claims

## Backend and contract rules

Ask the user `Python or R?` unless the backend is already fixed by the request
or file context. Once the backend is chosen, keep the workflow exclusive to that
backend for plotting, preview, export, and QA. If the runtime or packages are
missing, stop and report the blocker instead of silently falling back.

Before plotting, make the figure contract explicit:

- core conclusion
- evidence chain and source-data anchor
- panel map and figure archetype
- target journal or export bundle
- statistics, units, scale bars, or image provenance
- claim boundary and reviewer risk

## Figure package structure

Every serious output should be delivered as a figure package, not as a loose
image:

```text
figure-package/
  figure_contract.md
  source_data.csv
  plot.py or plot.R
  figure.svg
  figure.pdf
  figure.png
  figure.tiff
  caption.md
  qa_report.md
  asset_manifest.md
```

Audit the package with
`skills/materials-figure/scripts/audit_figure_package.py` before calling
it journal-ready.

## Example

- Figure package example:
  `skills/materials-figure/examples/figure-packages/wer-ea-dosage-window/`
- Additional package:
  `skills/materials-figure/examples/figure-packages/wer-ea-evidence-heatmap/`
- Atlas gallery:
  `skills/materials-figure/assets/wer-ea-atlas/generated/`

## Validation

- Audit script:
  `skills/materials-figure/scripts/audit_figure_package.py`
- Core tests live under `skills/materials-figure/tests/`
- Bundle verification:
  `python .\scripts\run_release_checks.py --json`

## Reproduction checklist

- backend resolved as `Python or R?`
- no cross-backend fallback used
- figure contract written before plotting
- source data or source-map anchor present
- export bundle includes SVG, PDF, PNG, and TIFF when possible
- caption states what the figure supports and what it does not prove
- QA report covers backend exclusivity, export checks, and caption boundary
- WER-EA mechanism claims stay bounded by real evidence

## Boundaries

This skill does not let pretty visuals overrule the scientific logic. If the
evidence chain or source data anchor is weak, the correct response is to flag
the risk or route back to reader, citation, writing, or data work before
polishing the image.
