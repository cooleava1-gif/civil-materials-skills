# Figure Production Specification

Use this reference before preparing final manuscript figures for CBM, CCC, Fuel, JCP, RMPD, IJPE, JBE, JRE, and related civil-materials journals. Always verify the current official guide for authors before final submission.

## Universal Production Checklist

- Export line charts, bar charts, and schematics as vector PDF/EPS/SVG when accepted.
- Export SEM, TEM, fluorescence, and optical images as TIFF when possible.
- Keep final-size text readable: usually >= 6 pt for Elsevier and >= 8 pt for Taylor & Francis after scaling.
- Use consistent axis style: `Property (unit)` or `Property / unit`, not both.
- Define all error bars in the caption.
- Add scale bars to all microscopy images.
- Use subfigure labels `(a)`, `(b)`, `(c)` consistently.
- Avoid red/green-only contrasts; use colorblind-safe palettes.

## Publisher-Oriented Defaults

| Journal family | Typical format | Resolution | Width guidance | Font guidance |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Elsevier materials journals: CBM, CCC, Fuel, JCP, RCR | TIFF, EPS, PDF | 300 dpi for photos, 600 dpi for combination art, 1000 dpi for line art when rasterized | single column about 85-90 mm; double column about 170-180 mm | Arial, Helvetica, Times; keep >= 6 pt after scaling |
| Taylor & Francis: RMPD, IJPE | EPS, TIFF, PDF | >= 300 dpi; higher for line art | single column about 82 mm; double column about 169 mm | Times New Roman or journal-safe serif/sans; keep >= 8 pt |
| ASCE: JMCE | TIFF, EPS, PDF | check current ASCE author guide | single/double column according to ASCE template | clear engineering axis labels and units |

## Data Figures vs. Image Figures

Data figures:

- Prefer vector output.
- Use raw points or error bars for small `n`.
- Keep gridlines light and non-dominant.
- Avoid 3D bars, shadows, and decorative gradients.

SEM/optical/fluorescence image figures:

- Use TIFF or high-quality PNG/TIFF source images.
- Do not stretch images non-uniformly.
- Preserve scale bars after panel assembly.
- State magnification or scale bar in caption.
- For multi-panel images, submit both assembled figure and original panels if requested.

## Civil Materials Caption Formula

Use:

```text
Figure X. [What is shown] for [material/system] under [condition]. Error bars
represent [SD/SE/95% CI] (n = [x]). [One cautious interpretation]. [Boundary
if mechanism or durability is inferred.]
```

Example:

```text
Figure 4. Pull-off bond strength of waterborne epoxy modified emulsified
asphalt at different epoxy contents after 7 d curing. Error bars represent
SD (n = 3). The 15% epoxy group showed the highest mean strength under the
tested condition; field performance requires additional moisture and traffic
exposure validation.
```

## Export Handoff

For each final figure, keep:

- source data CSV.
- plotting script or software project file.
- final vector/raster export.
- caption draft.
- notes on test standard, replicate count, and statistics.
