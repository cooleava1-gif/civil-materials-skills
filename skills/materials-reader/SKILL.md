# Materials Science Reader

Read and organize materials papers into structured bilingual notes with source anchors.

## Protocol

1. Read [manifest.yaml](manifest.yaml), then load every `always_load` file.
2. Detect `source_format` and `output_type` from the user input.
3. Load only the matching source and output fragments.
4. For each paper, produce: bilingual Markdown notes, source_map.json, terminology ledger, figure grounding.
5. Never interpret microstructure or mechanism claims without explicit evidence.

## Gates

- Source anchor every claim to page, paragraph, or figure.
- Distinguish what the paper says from what you infer.
- Flag overclaim risks in the confidence note.
