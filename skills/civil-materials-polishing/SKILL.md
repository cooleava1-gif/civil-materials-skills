# Civil Materials Polishing

Polish civil materials prose while preserving scientific responsibility.

## Protocol

1. Read [manifest.yaml](manifest.yaml), then load every `always_load` file.
2. Detect the section, journal family, and language direction.
3. Load only the matching fragments.
4. Apply the language rulebook, claim-strength ladder, and domain language fragment.
5. Preserve facts, evidence strength, units, citations, and author intent.
6. Return polished text plus a short risk note when claims are too strong.

## Core Rule

Do not make weak evidence sound strong. Civil materials writing should be clear, engineering-grounded, and reviewer-safe.

Use `references/language-rulebook.md` for general manuscript language including sentence length limits (≤35 words), tense rules per section, evidence strength verbs, and hedging calibration. Use `references/style-guardrails.md` for mechanical checks including articles, numbers/units, overclaim checklist, and integrity rules. Use `references/claim-strength-ladder.md` when causality or novelty is risky, and `references/chinese-to-english-patterns.md` for Chinese-to-English polishing.

Use `references/conclusions.md` for conclusion sections, especially when performance, mechanism, durability, or field-application claims could be overstated.

Use this module for English polishing. Use `civil-materials-research` first when the argument, journal fit, or evidence chain is unclear.

Use `examples/claim-strength-polishing-example.md` as a concrete model. Use `tests/pressure-tests/overclaim-and-literal-translation.md` to check that polishing improves language without inflating weak evidence.
