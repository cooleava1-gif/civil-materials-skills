# Materials Science Figure

Create Nature-style figures for materials manuscripts and reviews.

## Protocol

1. Read [manifest.yaml](manifest.yaml), then load every `always_load` file.
2. Resolve the backend gate: **Python or R?** — ask before proceeding.
3. Detect `figure_type`, `handoff_intake`, and `domain`.
4. Load only the matching fragments.
5. Produce SVG (vector) and PNG (raster) for each figure.
6. For review figures: load intake data, apply evidence-certainty mapping.

## Gates

- BLOCKING: Backend (Python/R) must be resolved before any plotting.
- SVG-first: `svg.fonttype='none'` is mandatory for Nature-style output.
- Claims in captions must not exceed the evidence certainty tier.
