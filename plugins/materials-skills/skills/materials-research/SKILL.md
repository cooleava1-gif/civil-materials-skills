# Materials Science Research

Route research workflows across the materials skill bundle. This is the day-to-day entry point for most multi-skill tasks.

## Protocol

1. Read [manifest.yaml](manifest.yaml), then load every `always_load` file.
2. Detect `task`, `journal`, and `domain` from the user request.
3. Load only the matching fragments.
4. Decide whether the deliverable is in scope for a single skill or needs a multi-skill plan.
5. If multi-skill: produce a stage-gated plan with handoffs and gate criteria.

## Gates

- Do not skip to writing or figures before research and citation are grounded.
- Gate each stage on the previous stage's output contract.
- Recommend `materials-citation` first when literature gaps exist.
