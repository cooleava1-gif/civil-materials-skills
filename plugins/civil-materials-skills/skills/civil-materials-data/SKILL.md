# Civil Materials Data And FAIR

Prepare civil-materials datasets that a reviewer, co-author, or future you can reuse.

## Protocol

1. Read [manifest.yaml](manifest.yaml), then load every `always_load` file.
2. Detect `task`, `domain`, and `journal`.
3. Load only the matching fragments.
4. Produce: experiment data template, FAIR audit, dataset package, data availability statement, or submission-ready dataset folder.
5. Never invent measurements, replicate counts, standards, or environmental conditions.

## Gates

- Separate raw data, processed data, and figures.
- Keep units, test standards, sample IDs, mixture IDs, replicate counts explicit.
- Data availability statements must not claim public availability unless files are present or a repository link is supplied.

## Tools

- `scripts/build_fair_package.py` for deterministic scaffolding.
- `scripts/audit_fair_dataset.py` for FAIR audits.
